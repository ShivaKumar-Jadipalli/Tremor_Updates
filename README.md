This tremor is torturing me man like every time i want to create a new folder it is taking too much time so I am putting this in my github so you can just download it and run
 `npm i ` 
to install everything 

remember this uses:
1. react v 18.2.0+ 
2. next.j = 14.2.23  

Here is the link incase you forget https://tremor.so/docs/getting-started/installation/next 


I also added some basic components like 
1. Button 
2. For now I couldn't think of anything I will add more in the future
